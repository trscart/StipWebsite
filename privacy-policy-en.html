                <p>Navigation data following consultation of this website and data related to identified or identifiable persons
                    may be processed. The computer systems and software procedures used to operate this domain acquire, during

                    the time of the request, the method used to submit the request to the server, the size of the file obtained
                    by the server (success, error, etc.) and other parameters related to the operating system and the user's
                    computer environment. These data are used only to obtain anonymous statistical information on the use
                    of the site and to check its correct functioning and are deleted immediately after processing. Data could

                    for the realization of the technical performance requested, and will be processed only by the employees.</p>

                </h6>
                <p>Cookies are small text files that the websites visited by the user send and record on his computer or mobile
                    device, to then be re-transmitted to the same sites at the next visit. Thanks to cookies a site remembers
                    the user's actions and preferences (such as, for example, login data, the chosen language, font sizes,
                    other display settings, etc.) so that they do not have to be indicated again when the user returns to
                    visit said site or browse from one page to another of it. Cookies are therefore used to perform computer
                    authentication, session monitoring and storage of information regarding the activities of users accessing
                    a site and may also contain a unique identification code that allows users to keep track of the user's
                    navigation within of the site itself for statistical or advertising purposes. While browsing a website,
                    the user can also receive on his computer or mobile device cookies from sites or web servers other than
                    the one he is visiting (s.c. "third-party" cookies). There are various types of cookies, depending on
                    their characteristics and functions, and these can remain on the user's computer or mobile device for
                    different periods of time: s.c. session cookie, which is automatically canceled when the browser is closed
                    or s.c. persistent cookies, which remain on the user's equipment until a set deadline. According to the
                    legislation in force in Italy, for the use of cookies an express user consent is not always required.
                    In particular, "technical cookies", ie those used for the sole purpose of transmitting a communication
                    over an electronic communication network, or in the measure strictly necessary to provide a service explicitly
                    requested by the user do not require this consent. In other words, these cookies are indispensable for
                    the functioning of the site or necessary to perform activities requested by the user. Among technical
                    cookies, that do not require an express consent for their use, the Italian Data Protection Authority
                    (see ‘Measure Identification of simplified procedures for information and the acquisition of consent
                    for the use of cookies’ May 8th, 2014, hereinafter only "Measure") also includes:

                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>For "profiling cookies" - vice versa - ie those aimed at creating user profiles and used in order to send
                    advertising messages in line with the preferences shown by the user in the context of web browsing, a
                    prior consent from the user is required.</p>
